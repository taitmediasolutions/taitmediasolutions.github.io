## what is luxury
- paradox of luxury
Luxury brings the best and worst due to it having the most beautiful products but also cost a lot of money

- "beyond quality"
- When a brand can claim they are unique then they are truly luxury, or the emotions
- There is no comparison, no positioning
- In premium brands aesthetics are very similar. In luxury brands there is almost no comparison
- In premium its more value for money

## What is the DNA of a brand
- Luxury brands talk about their dna not identity to be more unique
- DNA is not what the consumers want
- The meaning is important, not the words

## Codes
- Anything sense based about the brand, seen and appreciated
- Linked with DNA
- Example: brand logo, packaging
- What helps you identify the brand visually
- We must find codes that help
